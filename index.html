			<h2>How to get started?</h2>
			<p>Once you have a general idea of what you would want your website to look like, all you need to do reach out to us via email so you can share your ideas and first drafts. This allows us to better understand your vision and we can be on the same page from the very beginning. In addition to your ideas, please provide any media assets you'd like featured on the site, such as logos, images, or videos, as well as your preferred colour scheme. These elements play a key role in shaping the overall look and feel of your website. It's also welcomed if you do have any specific animations or effects you'd like us to implement, as this allows us to tailor the site to your individual style and needs. Just keep in mind our service is oriented towards creating visually engaging and useable static sites, as we currently do not offer web application creation, i.e., things like online reservation wizards or eCommerce stores.</p>
